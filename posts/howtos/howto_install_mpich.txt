0. Make sure you are using bash.
echo $SHELL
# if it is not bash, command: bash


1. Create a folder for mpich
mkdir /home/you/mpich

2. Download to that folder the latest stable version of mpich from:
https://www.mpich.org/downloads/

3. Unpack the tar file
tar xfz mpich-x-y-z.tar.gz

where mpich-x-y-z.tar.gz is the file you just downloaded, where x-y-z is the version.

4. Create 2 other folders
mkdir /home/you/mpich/build
mkdir /home/you/mpich/mpich-install

5. Enter the build directory and run the configuration script.
cd /home/you/mpich/build
../mpich-x-y-z/configure --with-device=ch4:ofi -prefix=/home/you/mpich/mpich-install 2>&1 | tee c.txt

6. Build mpich. Run command and go for a coffee:
make 2>&1 | tee m.txt

7. Install MPICH.
make install 2>&1 | tee mi.txt	


8. Add the bin subdirectory of the installation directory to your path:
export PATH=/home/you/mpich/mpich-install/bin:$PATH


9. Check if the installation went well:
which mpicc
which mpiexec

10. Test mpi in your machine by using the example file that the building process creates. That simple program computes the value of PI. If your machine has NC cores, then:
mpiexe -n NC ./examples/cpi
