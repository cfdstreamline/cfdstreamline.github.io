## [Code Projects](https://code.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"}
* Release Type: open-source


## [Code Utility Software Library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cfdutilities/){:target="_blank"}
* Release Type: open-source
* Description: Previously Aerodynamics Division Software Library at NASA Ames Research Center, the CFD Utility Software Library (previously known as the Aerodynamics Division Software Library at NASA Ames Research Center) contains nearly 30 libraries of generalized subroutines and close to 100 applications built upon those libraries.
